**Module-7-Challenge**

This is a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It utilizes Moment.js library to work with date and time.

**User Story**

As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria**

The application should meet the following criteria:

- Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
- Present time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
- Color-code each time block based on whether it is in the past, present, or future.
- Allow the user to enter an event when they click a time block.
- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that time block.
- Persist events between page refreshes.

**technology**

For this challenged I have used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- Fontawesome
- Jquery
- Moment.js

**Deployment**

The application is deployed and can be accessed at live URL: https://antoninogambino.github.io/Module-7-Challenge/

The source code can be found at GitHub repository: https://github.com/antoninogambino/Module-7-Challenge.git

**Functionality**

When the user opens the application, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. The time blocks for standard business hours are presented below. Each time block is color-coded based on whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).

To add an event, the user can click on a time block and enter the desired event. After entering the event, the user can click the save button in that time block to save the event in local storage.

The events will persist between page refreshes, allowing the user to access their saved events even after closing and reopening the application.
